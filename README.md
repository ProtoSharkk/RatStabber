### LORE
After defeating the Paul bots, the rat improved upon the design to create the rat bots. However, the ratbots became evil for a reason and turned against the rat, taking his weapons as well. You have arrived to protect the rat until it can figure out a way to stop the now evil rat bots of its own creation.
